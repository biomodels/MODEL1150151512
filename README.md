**Abstract:**   
We have developed a mathematical model of the mouse ventricular myocyte action
potential (AP) from voltage-clamp data of the underlying currents and Ca 2+
transients. Wherever possible, we used Markov models to represent the
molecular structure and function of ion channels. The model includes detailed
intracellular Ca 2+ dynamics, with simulations of localized events such as
sarcoplasmic Ca 2+ release into a small intracellular volume bounded by the
sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Transporter-mediated Ca 2+ fluxes from
the bulk cytosol are closely matched to the experimentally reported values and
predict stimulation rate-dependent changes in Ca 2+ transients. Our model
reproduces the properties of cardiac myocytes from two different regions of
the heart: the apex and the septum. The septum has a relatively prolonged AP,
which reflects a relatively small contribution from the rapid transient
outward K + current in the septum. The attribution of putative molecular bases
for several of the component currents enables our mouse model to be used to
simulate the behavior of genetically modified transgenic mice.

This SBML model has been converted from a CellML model (see: [Bondarenko 2004
vers. 5 var. 1](http://www.cellml.org/models/bondarenko_szigeti_bett_kim_rasmu
sson_2004_version05_variant01) ) in the [CellML
repository](http://www.cellml.org/models) .  
It has been slightly changed and a parameter E_try been introduced to make it
valid SBML. The CellML model was orginally created by:  
James Lawson  
Auckland Bioengineering Institute  
j.lawson(at)auckland.ac.nz  
  
From the original CellML model:  
The [original CellML model version](http://www.cellml.org/models/bondarenko_sz
igeti_bett_kim_rasmusson_2004_version05_variant01) "has been curated by Penny
Noble from Oxford University and is known to run in COR and PCEnv. This model
represents the APICAL CELL variant as described in Bondarenko et al.'s 2004
paper and all units are consistent. The model is able to reproduce the action
potential traces from Figure 16 of the publication. This model has a PCEnv
session file associated with it."
